# Predicting Survival on Titanic

Objective:

Building penalized logistic regression model for predicting survival on Titanic.

Data set:

Kaggle provides train and test data for Titanic project. Train data has 891 observations (observation 1
to 891) and test data has 418 observations (observation 892 to 1309). Combining train and test data, in
total Titanic data has 1309 observations. This data set consists of 12 variables, 10 of them are predictors,
1 response variable, and 1 variable for passenger id. Response variable is Survived. Survived is survival
status of Titanic passengers, 1 for survived and 0 for not survived. Variable Survived in train data has been
labeled into 0 or 1, in other words survival status of every passengers has been given in train data. In test
data, variable Survived has not been labeled into 0 or 1. The survival status of passengers in test data will
be predicted using predictive model.
